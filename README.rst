Ubik Sentiment repository
========================

This creates a simple classifer to classify positivity or negativity of a given sentiment. The training data can be got with a simpler heuristic: search sentences from a large corpus where there are happy smile ':)' and sad smileys ':(' which we can presume to be positive and negative sentences respectively and thus note for positive or negative emotions.
